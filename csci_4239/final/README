Final project

Description:
   So far I've been messing with some of the more difficult shaders and trying to make them look right. What I've got so far is just a testing playground - the next step is to combine everything together to make a complete scene. I've broken down all the little bits below.
   
   Height-mapped terrain:
      This was meant to overcome slowdowns I experienced with last semester's project by loading in .obj files. It reads a .bmp in as a texture and models the terrain's height after that. The next step is to use the gba channels to provide other data such as color.
   Particles:
      I've been trying to get falling snow particles to look less predictible by using a 3D noise texture to simulate more or less 'wind' at certain spots. It could be going better. It needs lots of tweeking.
   Water:
      The water uses two textures moving in opposite directions across it's surface to change height and color values, as well as pseudo-randomly create a 'shine' at the top of waves. I think it looks pretty good.
      
   To do:
      - Per pixel lighting
      - Normal mapping
      - Bloom lighting
      - Reflections
      - Whatever else looks nice

Key bindings:
 *  mouse      Change view angle
 *  arrows     Change view angle
 *  m/M        Toggle between shaders
 *  PgDn/PgUp  Zoom in and out
 *  0          Reset view angle
 *  ESC        Exit
