Highlights:
===========

   Helicopter clips correctly with terrain - set it down anywhere and it'll rest nicely on top
   Trees sway slightly, as if in the wind
   Helicopter has lag time and momentum in it's movements and turns
   The helicopter's side windows are transparent, as can be seen while turning
   Helicopter clips with trees... with moderately high success rates

Time taken:
===========
I've lost count ages ago.
